# Monorail
A simple 2D and 3D cross-platform game-engine made with DotNet Core using OpenGL 4.

This is more of a learning project for computer graphics aiming to do the bare minimal needed for a game engine, nothing fancy here :P

## Roadmap
- [x] 2D batch rendering
- [ ] Advanced 3D rendering
    - [ ] Advanced lighting
    - [ ] Cascade Shadow Mapping
    - [ ] Deferred rendering
- [ ] 2D/3D Level editor
- [ ] 2D/3D physics
    - [ ] Static bodies
    - [ ] Dynamic bodies
    - [ ] Rigid bodies
- [ ] Entity-Component Scene
- [ ] Scripting functionality

## Dependencies
- .Net Core 3.1
- The core of this engine is [OpenTK 4](https://github.com/opentk/opentk)
- For console logging: [Colorful Console](https://github.com/tomakita/Colorful.Console)
- For GUI: [ImGui.NET](https://github.com/mellinoe/imgui.net)

## Acknoledgements
- This game engine started as my own version of [Hazel](https://github.com/TheCherno/Hazel)
- Also heavily inspired by the [Monogame Framework](https://www.monogame.net/) and [Nez](https://github.com/prime31/nez)
- The usage design is inspired by [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) and [Unity](https://unity.com/)
